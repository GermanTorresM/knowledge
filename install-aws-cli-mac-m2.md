## Step 1: Install Homebrew
The first step to installing the AWS CLI on your Mac M2 is to install Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. Homebrew makes it easy to install and manage command-line tools on your Mac.
To install Homebrew, open Terminal and run the following command:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

## Step 2: Install Python 3
Next, you’ll need to install Python 3, a prerequisite for installing the AWS CLI.
To install Python 3 using Homebrew, run the following command:

```
brew install python@3.9
```

This will install Python 3.9 on your Mac.

## Step 3: Install the AWS CLI
With Python 3 installed, you can now install the AWS CLI using pip, the Python package manager.
To install the AWS CLI, run the following command:

```
pip3 install awscli --upgrade --user
```

This will install the latest version of the AWS CLI and ensure that it’s up to date.

## Step 4: Configure the AWS CLI
Once you’ve installed the AWS CLI, you’ll need to configure it with your AWS credentials. You can do this using the aws configure command.
To configure the AWS CLI, run the following command:

```
aws configure
```

You’ll be prompted to enter your AWS access key ID, secret access key, default region name, and default output format. Then, follow the prompts to enter your credentials and configure the AWS CLI.
Tip: If you struggle with installation, just open a web browser and go to the AWS CLI installation page: https://aws.amazon.com/cli/ and download the installation package.

## Step 5: Verify the AWS CLI Installation
To verify that the AWS CLI is installed and configured correctly, you can run the following command:

```
aws ec2 describe-instances
```

This command should return a list of EC2 instances in your AWS account, indicating that the AWS CLI works appropriately.
